\frametitle{Difference between previous projection scheme and 
the current algebraic scheme}

Previously, we solved 
the following equation for $\phi$ 
\[
\nabla^2  \phi = - \frac{1}{\Delta t} \nabla \cdot u^* 
\]
now the equation reads:  
\[
B^T M^{-1} B \phi = - \frac{1}{\Delta t} B^T u^* 
\]
\begin{itemize}
\item 
$B^T$ is a discrete divergence 
\item 
$B$ is a discrete gradient
\item 
$M$ (and its inverse) is a discrete identity operator  
\end{itemize}
Hence the two equations seem very similar. 
An important difference is however that $\nabla^2$ requires
a set of boundary conditions whereas  $B^T M^{-1} B$ 
have boundary conditions built in.
