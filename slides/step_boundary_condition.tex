  \frametitle{Step by step: defining a boundary condition}

  The following code defines a Dirichlet boundary condition:

\begin{python}
bc = DirichletBC(V, u0, u0_boundary)
\end{python}

  \bigskip

  This boundary condition states that a function in the function space
  defined by \emp{V} should be equal to \emp{u0} on the boundary
  defined by \emp{u0\_boundary}

  \bigskip

  Note that the above line does not yet apply the boundary condition
  to all functions in the function space
