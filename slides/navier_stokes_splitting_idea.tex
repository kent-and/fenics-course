  \frametitle{Splitting scheme for Navier-Stokes: Core idea}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Solving the full coupled system for the velocity and the pressure
    simultaneously is computationally expensive.
  \item
    To reduce computational cost, iterative \emph{splitting schemes}
    are an attractive alternative.
  \item
    Splitting schemes are typically based on solving for the velocity
    and the pressure separately.
  \item
    We will consider a splitting scheme solving three different
    (smaller!) systems at each time step $n$:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      Compute the \emph{tentative velocity}
    \item
      Compute the \emph{pressure}
    \item
      Compute the \emph{corrected velocity}
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    Next slides show how the scheme is derived -- time to pay close attention!
  \end{itemize}
