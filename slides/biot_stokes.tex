We remember Stokes problem 
This equation may be written as a saddle point problem 
\[
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
-\nabla^2 & -\nabla \\
\nabla\cdot & 0  
\end{array}
\right]
\left[
\begin{array}{c} u \\ p \end{array} 
\right]
= 
\left[
\begin{array}{c} f \\ 0 \end{array} 
\right]
\]

In our case $A$ and $C$ are different. 
This equation may be written as a saddle point problem 
\[
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
-\nabla\cdot 2 \mu \epsilon - \nabla \lambda \nabla \cdot & -\nabla  \\
\nabla\cdot  & -s+\nabla\cdot K \nabla  
\end{array}
\right]
\left[
\begin{array}{c} u \\ p \end{array} 
\right]
= 
\left[
\begin{array}{c} f \\ g \end{array} 
\right]
\]

\begin{itemize}
\item We already addressed the difference between $\nabla^2$ and $\nabla\cdot \epsilon$   
\item We therefore replace $\nabla\cdot \epsilon$ with $\nabla^2$ to simplify the discussion  
\item We known that large $\lambda$ is associated with  locking of displacement  
\item Pressure oscillations are associated with  $K$ small or with large jumps  
\end{itemize}
