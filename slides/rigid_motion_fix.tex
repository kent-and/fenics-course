\frametitle{Ways to remove the singularity}
There are several ways to remove the singularity of the elasticity stiffness matrix $A$
in the case of a pure Neumann problem:
\begin{itemize}
\item Pin-point the displacement in selected points (6 degrees of freedom must be removed)
\item Penalize rigid motions
\item Orthogonalize solution and input data with respect rigid motions and use iterative solvers
      capable of ignoring the kernel
\item Use the method of Lagrange multipliers to deal with the rigid motions
\end{itemize}
The first three methods here often require tuning and care. We will therefore not go through
them in detail.
The last method is the easiest and cleanest from a mathematical point of view,
but the elasticity problem then changes from an elliptic problem to a saddle-point problem
