  \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Write a program that generates the sequence $(x_n)_{n=0}^{100}$ for
      $x_n = n$.
    \item
      Write a program that generates the odd numbers between $1$ and $100$.
    \item
      Write a program that computes the sum $\sum_{n=0}^{100} x_n$ for
      $x_n = n$.
    \item
      Write a program that computes the sum of the odd numbers between $1$
      and $100$.
    \item
      Write a program that generates all prime numbers between $2$ and $1000$.
    \item
      Write a program that generates the first $1000$ prime numbers.
    \item
      Write a program that computes the approximation $\sqrt{2} \approx
      x_{100}$ for $x_{n} = (x_{n-1} + 2/x_{n-1}) / 2$ and $x_0 = 1$.
    \item
      Write a program that computes the approximation $\sqrt{2} \approx
      x_{N}$ for $x_{n} = (x_{n-1} + 2/x_{n-1}) / 2$ and $x_0 = 1$ where $N$
      is the smallest number such that $|x_{N} - x_{N-1}| < 10^{-10}$ .
    \item
      Write a program that generates the sequence $(x_n)_{n=0}^{N}$
      for $N = 10^6$ when
      \begin{equation}
        x_n = 4 \sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k / (2k + 1).
      \end{equation}
      Does it seem to converge to some particular number?
    \end{itemize}
