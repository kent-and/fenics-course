  \emph{The finite element method is a framework and a recipe for
    discretization of mathematical problems in general}

  Examples: 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Ordinary differential equations
  \item
    Partial differential equations
  \item
    Integral equations
  \end{itemize}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    A recipe for discretization of PDE
  \item
    That is, PDE $\rightarrow$ $Ax = b$
  \item
    Issues that arise: choice of bases, stabilization, error control, adaptivity, computational complexity
  \end{itemize}
