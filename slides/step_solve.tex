  \frametitle{Step by step: solving variational problems}

  Once a variational problem has been defined, it may be solved
  by calling the \emp{solve} function:

  \begin{python}
u = Function(V)
solve(a == L, u, bc)
  \end{python}

  \bigskip

  Note the reuse of the variable name \emp{u} as both a \emp{TrialFunction}
  in the variational problem and a \emp{Function} to store the solution.
