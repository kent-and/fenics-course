\begin{itemize}
\item For time-dependent flow simulations in 3D, tricks are needed for efficiency! 
\item We need to discretize in \emph{both} time and space 
\item First we consider methods where we: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Discretize in \emph{time} 
\item Do some tricks involving splitting the unknowns  
\item Discretize in \emph{space} 
\end{itemize}
Second we consider methods where we: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Discretize in \emph{space} 
\item Discretize in \emph{time} 
\item Attempt to do some tricks 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
The first approach here is the most efficient, but is associated with 
problematic boundary conditions and boundary layers, as we will see 

\vspace{0.3cm}
The second approach is the most mathematically correct approach, but 
currently these schemes are typically less efficient than the first
approach
