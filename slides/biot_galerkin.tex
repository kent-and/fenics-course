\frametitle{Is the best approximation the best approximation?}
\begin{itemize}
\item The finite element method actually find the best approximation (in the inner
product defined by our weak form)
\item Clearly, we saw \emph{un-physical oscillations} 
\item This illustrates that the best approximation may be treacherous 
\item To guarantee oscillation-free solutions we would need monotom schemes 
or schemes that conserve special properties 
\item In this case it is natural to employ more advanced (mixed) schemes
for the Darcy problem
\end{itemize}
