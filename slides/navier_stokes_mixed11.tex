\frametitle{The advantages and challenges with the implicit  algebraic splitting scheme}

The implicit splitting scheme requires us to solve 
\[
B^T (M + \Delta t (N(u^n)  +  A)) ^{-1} B  
\]
This matrix is usually called the pressure Schur complement 

\vspace{0.3cm}
Currently there are no robust and efficient way of solving this even though 
there are many solution algorithms that work in special cases

\vspace{0.3cm}
And advantage was that there is no need for artificial boundary conditions

\vspace{0.3cm}
Another advantage is that the previous scheme may be ran several times for one 
time step to obtain a scheme that is more than first order in time
(this is in fact utilized in the more method
Generalized Richardson iteration for the pressure Schur complement (GRPC) which 
does precisely this - see the background material)
