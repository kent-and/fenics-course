  Compute the deflection of a regular $10 \times 2 $ LEGO brick as
  function of time. Use the St.~Venant--Kirchhoff model and assume
  that the LEGO brick is made of PVC plastic. The LEGO brick is
  subject to gravity of size $g = -9.81~\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}^2$ and a
  downward traction of size $5000~\mathrm{N}/\mathrm{m}^2$ at its end
  point. At time $t = 0$, the brick is at rest in its undeformed
  state.

  To check your solution, compute the average value of the
  displacement in the $z$-direction at time $T = 0.05$. Use a time
  step of size $k = 0.002$.
