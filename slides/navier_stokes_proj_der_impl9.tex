Let us then use homogenous Neumann conditions. 
What happens with the velocity when using these conditions? 

\vspace{0.3cm}
We have the velocity update 
\[
u^{n+1} =  u^*- \frac{\Delta t}{\rho} \nabla \phi 
\]
since we use homogenous Neumann for $\phi$, $\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial n} = 0$
and 
\[
u^{n+1} \cdot n =  u^* \cdot n  
\]
and the \alert{normal component of $u^{n+1}$ is correct} since $u^*$ has the right boundary conditions  

\vspace{0.3cm}
However, the tangential component of $\nabla \phi$ is in general non-zero.
Therefore,  \alert{$u^{n+1} \cdot t$ will not be correct}, since   
\[
u^{n+1} \cdot t =  u^* \cdot t - \frac{\Delta t}{\rho} \nabla \phi \cdot t 
\]
