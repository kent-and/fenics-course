The DAE-system:  
\begin{eqnarray*}
M \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} +  N(u) u  +  A u +  B p &=& f  \\
B^T u &=& 0 
\end{eqnarray*}
is terrible! It is  
\begin{itemize}
\item non-linear  
\item non-symmetric 
\item indefinite 
\end{itemize}
Efficienct algorithms for solving this system is still and open question. 
You may get multilevel, domain decomposition methods to work but 
it is hard and application-dependent
