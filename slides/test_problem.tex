  \frametitle{A test problem}

  We construct a test problem for which we can easily check the
  answer. We first define the exact solution by
  \begin{equation*}
    u(x, y) = 1 + x^2 + 2y^2
  \end{equation*}

  \bigskip

  We insert this into Poisson's equation:

  \begin{equation*}
     f = -\Delta u = -\Delta (1 + x^2 + 2y^2) = -(2 + 4) = -6
  \end{equation*}

  \bigskip

  This technique is called the \emph{method of manufactured solutions}
