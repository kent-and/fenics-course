\frametitle{Summary, projection schemes}
\begin{itemize}
\item Projection schemes like IPCS are the most efficient on the market today
for transient flows  
\item The schemes do not require special mixed elements and have 
      for this reason been prefered 
\item There are issues with boundary layers, errors etc that you need to be aware of
\item In many applications, the main interest is what happens on the boundary, if so be careful
\item In the scheme, we first compute a tentative velocity, then project this
velocity onto the space of divergence free functions  
\item Is the velocity divergence free after the projection step? 
\end{itemize}
