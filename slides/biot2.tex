\frametitle{Biot's equations of poroelasticity} 
The equations are a coupling of linear elasticity 
and porous Darcy flow. It has a number of
intesting and challenging features: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Second order derivative in time  
$\rho u_{tt}$ 
\item First order derivatives in time 
$ s \frac{\partial p}{\partial t}$ and $ \alpha \frac{\nabla \cdot u}{\partial t}$
\item Three elliptic terms 
$\nabla\cdot 2 \mu \epsilon(u)$, $\nabla \lambda \nabla \cdot u I$, and  $\nabla \cdot (K \nabla p)$ 
\item 
$\nabla \lambda \nabla \cdot u I$ is associated with locking of the displacement as we learned 
in linear elasticity  
\item For $\nabla \cdot (K \nabla p)$, $K$ may be very small or contain large discontinuities resulting in
pressure oscillations  
\end{enumerate}
Hence, this is a challenging numerical problem which is currently heavily investigated
