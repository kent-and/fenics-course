 \frametitle{The Brezzi conditions, linear algebra point of view, cont'd. }
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Continuity and coersivity of $A_h$ ensures that $A_h$ is non-singular 
 \item Continuity and inf-sup condition of $B_h$ ensures that $B_h$ is non-singular 
 \end{itemize}
Remember that $B_h$ is a rectangular matrix! The inf-sup condition corresponds to 
coersivity of  $B_h B_h^T$, where $B_h$ is a discrete divergence and $B_h^T$ the
discrete gradient.    

\vspace{0.3cm}
We also remark that the coersivity and inf-sup conditions are not inherited from 
the continuous operators while continuity is inherited (for conforming methods).
