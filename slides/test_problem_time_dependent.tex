  We construct a test problem for which we can easily check the
  answer. We first define the exact solution by
  \begin{equation*}
    u = 1 + x^2 + \alpha y^2 + \beta t
  \end{equation*}

  \bigskip

  We insert this into the heat equation:

  \begin{equation*}
     f = \dot{u} - \Delta u = \beta - 2 - 2\alpha
  \end{equation*}

  \bigskip

  The initial condition is
  \begin{equation*}
    u^0 = 1 + x^2 + \alpha y^2
  \end{equation*}

  \bigskip

  This technique is called the \emph{method of manufactured solutions}
