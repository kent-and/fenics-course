\frametitle{A mixed form linear elasticy to avoid locking}

Let us introduce an artifical uknown "the solid pressure" 
\[
p = \lambda \nabla \cdot u 
\]
The equation of linear elasticity, 
\begin{align*}
-2 \mu (\nabla \cdot \epsilon (u)) - \lambda \nabla (\nabla \cdot u) = f
\end{align*}
can then be written as
\begin{align*}
\label{el:eq}
-2 \mu (\nabla \cdot \epsilon (u)) -\nabla p &= f \\
\nabla\cdot u - \frac{1}{\lambda} p &= 0  
\end{align*}

This is just a re-write, we have done nothing wrong! 
But we would like to stress that the "solid pressure" 
is not a physical pressure in the normal sense
