 \frametitle{The Brezzi conditions, linear algebra point of view, cont'd. }
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Continuity and coersivity of $A_h$ ensures that $A_h$ is non-singular 
 \item Continuity and inf-sup condition of $B_h$ ensures that $B_h$ is non-singular 
 \end{itemize}
How come we need inf-sup condition on $B_h$ ? The coersivity condition seems easier to deal with!
