\frametitle{Difference between previous projection scheme and 
the current algebraic scheme}

Previously, we solved 
the following equation for $\phi$ 
\[
\nabla^2  \phi = - \frac{1}{\Delta t} \nabla \cdot u^* 
\]
now the equation reads:  
\[
B^T M^{-1} B \phi = - \frac{1}{\Delta t} B^T u^* 
\]
How do these two equations compare?
