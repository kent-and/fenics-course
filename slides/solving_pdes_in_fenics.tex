  Solving a physical problem with FEniCS consists of the following steps:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    Identify the PDE and its boundary conditions
  \item
    Reformulate the PDE problem as a variational problem
  \item
    Make a Python program where the formulas in the variational
    problem are coded, along with definitions of input data such as $f$,
    $u_0$, and a mesh for $\Omega$
  \item
    Add statements in the program for solving the variational problem,
    computing derived quantities such as $\nabla u$, and visualizing
    the results
  \end{enumerate}
