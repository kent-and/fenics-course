  \frametitle{The finite element definition is kind of abstract}

  A finite element is a triple $(T, \mathcal{V}, \mathcal{L})$, is
  used as follows  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    the domain $T$ is used to divide the mesh into subdomains represented by $T$ 
  \item
   the space $\mathcal{V}$ is used to evaluate the variational forms  locally for each subdomain $T$ 
  \item
   the set of degrees of freedom $\mathcal{L}$ is used to glue together 
    the localized function space ($\mathcal{V}$) to a global
    function space using the degrees of freedom 
  \end{itemize}
