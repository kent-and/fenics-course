\frametitle{An implicit projection scheme, cont'd}
Let us, to simplify notation, introduce
a convection-diffusion operator $s$: 
\[
s(u^c) =   \Delta t (-u^n \cdot \nabla u^c +  \nu \nabla^2 u^c)  
\]
Then the velocity correction step can be written as 
\begin{align*}
u^c - s(u^c) + \frac{\Delta t}{\rho} \nabla \phi &= 0 \\ 
\nabla \cdot u^c &= \nabla \cdot u^* 
\end{align*}
\alert{Nothing has been gained!} \\
This problem is just as hard as the original equations! \\
However, we remark that the $s(u^c)$ term is a first-order term in time.\\ 
Hence, we may ignore this term and still obtain a first order approximation. 
We obtain: 
\begin{align*}
u^c + \frac{\Delta t}{\rho} \nabla \phi &= 0 \\ 
\nabla \cdot u^c &= \nabla \cdot u^* 
\end{align*}
