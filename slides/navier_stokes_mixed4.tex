\frametitle{Discretization in space before time, cont'd}
\begin{itemize}
\item 
When we did discretization in time before space we derived
a scheme consisting of computing a tenative velocity and
then a projection step. 
\item 
The scheme had two disadvantages: it was \alert{first order} and 
there were \alert{errors associated with the boundaries} 
\item 
Both of these disadvantages can in principle be removed by the technique
described in the following, but currently at the expense of efficiency 
\end{itemize}
