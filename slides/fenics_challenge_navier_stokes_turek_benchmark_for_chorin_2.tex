    The inflow boundary lies at $x = -0.2$ and the outflow boundary at
    $x=2.0$.
    Compute the flow on the time interval $[0,8]$ with time-step $dt =
    0.001$. Test your implementation first for a larger time-step $dt =
    0.01$ and the same channel problem but with the cylinder removed.
    If everything goes fine you should get something like
