  \small

  Compute the solution of the Poisson problem on the unit square with
  right-hand side $f = e^{-100(x^2 + y^2)}$ and homogeneous Dirichlet
  boundary conditions.

  Try to compute the solution as accurately as possible, using
  adaptive mesh refinement. Use any one of the techniques described
  in the lecture notes, or invent your own refinement strategy.

  To check your answer, plot the $L^2$ norm as function of the
  refinement level. You should get an answer that approaches
  \texttt{8.888e-05}.

  \emph{Hint:} Refine in the lower left corner.

  \emph{The student who computes the most accurate solution will be
    rewarded with an exclusive FEniCS surprise!}
