\frametitle{An implicit projection scheme, cont'd}
\begin{itemize}
\item We have arrived at two sub-problems that are possible to solve efficiently and accurately with 
current methods
\item The scheme is first order, second order schemes have been claimed but (as far as I know) 
there is always some assumptions that are not always explicitly stated 
\item We will not go into details on these assumptions (details are in the paper of Langtangen et. al. 
\item There are issues with this scheme, regarding the boundary conditions
\item Lets first summarize the scheme, which has many names, but we call it \emph{incremental pressure correction scheme} (IPCS)  
\end{itemize}
