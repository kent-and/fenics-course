\frametitle{Derivation of project schemes, cont'd}
\begin{itemize}
\item We developed a scheme involving only a Poisson equation and explicit updates!  
\item We skipped details concerning the boundary conditions, we will look into that later
\item This method of thinking, where we first construct a tentative velocity and then 
modify to account for the divergence constraint and update the pressure is a general strategy! 
\item We now turn to implicit methods, but remember that this explicit scheme is very easy
to implement on parallel computers 
\end{itemize}
