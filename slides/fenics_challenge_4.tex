  Solve the partial differential equation
  \begin{equation*}
    -\Delta u = f
  \end{equation*}
  with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions on the unit square
  for $f(x, y) = 2\pi^2\sin(\pi x)\sin(\pi y)$. Plot the error in the
  $L^2$ norm as function of the mesh size $h$ for a sequence of
  refined meshes. Try to determine the convergence rate.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \emph{Who can obtain the smallest error?}
  \item
    \emph{Who can compute a solution with an error smaller than
    $\epsilon = 10^{-6}$ in the fastest time?}
  \end{itemize}

  \emph{The best students(s) will be rewarded with a FEniCS surprise!}
