    Implement a solver for Hagen--Poiseuille flow
    (parabolic flow profile) in a 2D channel based on the
    $\PP_2/\,\PP_1$ Taylor-Hood element. Assume that
    \begin{itemize}
        \item the channel is of length $l = 5$ and height $h = 1$
        \item $v_{\text{max}} = 1$
        \item an inflow boundary condition is given on
            $\Gamma_{\text{in}}$
        \item a no-slip boundary condition is given at the channel
            walls $\Gamma_{\text{out}}$.
        \item a ``do-nothing'' boundary condition ($g_N = 0$) is imposed on the
            outflow boundary $\Gamma_{\text{out}}$
    \end{itemize}
