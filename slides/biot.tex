\frametitle{Biot's equations of poroelasticity} 
The Biot's equations of poroelasticity describe the fluid--structure interaction
between a porous elastic media saturated  
by a pressurized fluid 

\vspace{0.3cm}
The equations have many forms, one common form is the displacement-pressure formulation: 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\rho u_{tt} - \nabla\cdot 2 \mu \epsilon(u) - \nabla \lambda \nabla \cdot u I + \alpha \nabla p &=& f \\   
s \frac{\partial p}{\partial t} + \alpha \frac{\nabla \cdot u}{\partial t} - \nabla \cdot (K \nabla p) &=& g 
\end{eqnarray*}
Here 
\begin{itemize}
\item $u$ and $p$ are the uknown displacement and pressure
\item $\rho$ is the density 
\item $\mu$ and $\lambda$ are  Lam\'{e}'s elastic parameters
\item $s$ is the storage coefficent
\item $K$ is the hydralic conductivity (permeability / viscosity) 
\end{itemize}
\emph{The challenge is to find schemes that are robust to (large) variations
in particular in $\lambda$ and $K$.}
