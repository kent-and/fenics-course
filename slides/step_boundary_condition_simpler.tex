  The following code defines a Dirichlet boundary condition:
\vspace{-1em}
\begin{python}
bc = DirichletBC(V, u0, "on_boundary")
\end{python}

  This boundary condition states that a function in the function space
  defined by \emp{V} should be equal to \emp{u0} on the domain defined
  by \emp{"on\_boundary"}

  \bigskip

  Note that the above line does not yet apply the boundary condition
  to all functions in the function space
