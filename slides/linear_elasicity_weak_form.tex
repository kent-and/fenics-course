\frametitle{Weak form and finite element method}
For the moment we consider the \alert{pure Neumann problem}\\ 
Find $u\in H^1$ such that
\[
a(u,v)  = f(v), \quad \forall v\in H^1 
\]
Here 
\[
a(u,v) = \mu (\epsilon(u), \epsilon(v)) + \lambda (\nabla\cdot  u, \nabla\cdot v)
\]  
\[
f(v) = (f,v) + \int_{\partial \Omega} g v ds
\] 
From the weak form we obtain a linear system $A u = f$
by using the finite element method, where 
the stiffness matrix involved in linear elasticity is obtained as 
\[
A_{ij} = a(N_i, N_j)
\]
where $\{N_i\}$ are the finite element basis functions
