The equation of linear elasticity:
\begin{align}
\label{el:eq}
-2 \mu (\nabla \cdot \epsilon (u)) - \lambda \nabla (\nabla \cdot u) = 0.
\end{align}
\begin{itemize}
\item the  Lam\'{e} parameter $\lambda$ represents how easily the
material compressed.
\item often $\lambda \gg \mu$
\item physically this means that it is a lot easier to twist (cause shear) than to compress the material
\item incompressible liquids are extreme examples that easily deform but are never compressed
\item simple numerical schemes do not distinguish between compression and shearing
\item if $\lambda \gg \mu$ standard schemes underestimate the deformation
\item the phenomenon is called \emph{locking}
\end{itemize}
