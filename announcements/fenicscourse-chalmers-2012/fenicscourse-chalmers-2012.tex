Everyone interested in mathematical modeling and computational
mathematics is invited to a two-day mini course on solving partial
differential equations in Python. The course will be based on the
free/open-source software FEniCS for automated solution of
differential equations in Python (and C++). FEniCS has a powerful set
of features and allows finite element variational problems to be
specified in near-mathematical notation directly as part of a Python
program. For example, the variational problem for the Poisson
equation,
\begin{equation}
  \int_{\Omega} \grad u \cdot \grad v \dx = \int_{\Omega} f v \dx
  \quad \forall v \in V,
\end{equation}
can be directly translated to the following FEniCS program:
\begin{python}
u = TrialFunction(V)
v = TestFunction(V)

a = dot(grad(u), grad(v))*dx
L = f*v*dx
\end{python}
Variational problems like the one above may be solved automatically in
FEniCS:
\begin{python}
u = Function(V)
solve(a == L, u)
\end{python}
Other key features of FEniCS include high performance linear algebra,
automatic adaptive mesh refinement, postprocessing, and support for a
wide range of finite element function spaces, including high order
spaces and vector elements.

Topics covered in the course include: installation of FEniCS on
GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows, solving linear static PDEs, solving
nonlinear static PDEs, solving linear time-dependent PDEs, mixed
problems, splitting methods, and postprocessing of solutions in
ParaView. Partial differential equations solved in the course include
the Poisson equation, a nonlinear Poisson equation, the Stokes
equations, nonlinear hyperelasticity (St. Venant--Kirchhoff), and the
incompressible Navier--Stokes equations.

Participants are expected to have a working knowledge of Python. Bring
your laptops and be ready to solve a set of interesting exercises.
Participants are encouraged to download and install the FEniCS
software on their laptops prior to the course, but this is not a
requirement. Participants are also encouraged to buy or download a
copy of the FEniCS book. The book and the software are freely
available from the FEniCS Project web site:
\texttt{http://fenicsproject.org/}
