Note to lecturers: Don't run examples in this directory since it will
lead to syncing garbage to the server when we upload. Copy to separate
directory before running!

The source directories named 'apa', 'kul' etc are hidden on the server
and the password is the name of the directory. Give to students after
end of lecture.

02_static_linear_pdes       kul
03_static_nonlinear_pdes    apa
04_time_dependent_pdes      ser
06_static_hyperelasticity   meg
07_dynamic_hyperelasticity  gul
08_stokes                   jak
09_navier_stokes            tar


List of passwords for future lectures:
