This script was created during the Jyväskylä summer school in 2013
where it became obvious that most students were not able to run the
code for lecture 7 (dynamic hyperelasticity) even if it runs in a
little more than one minute on my laptop (using 4 cores).

Please keep the code as is so that results can be compared with
historical results.
